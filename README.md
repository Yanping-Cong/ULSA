# ULSA

## Ultra Long wavelength Sky model with Absorption(ULSA)
--------
The ULSA implementation of the NE2001 electron model using in 3D emissivity of galaxy to produce a sky map below 10MHz.

The output can be stored either in memory by means of a numpy array, or in a HDF5 format file.

## Installation
```
as root user:
python setup.py install or python setup.py develop
for user only:
